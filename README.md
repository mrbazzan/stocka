The RDBMS is PostgreSQL. Create a database called `stocka` with `postgres` as the user/owner.
- Save `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` as environmental variable.
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` is the password of the PostgreSQL database you're connecting to.
- `EMAIL_PASSWORD` is the password for the email used to send activation URL. Ask for this password from the backend team lead.

```shell script
set POSTGRES_PASSWORD='enter-the-password'
set EMAIL_PASSWORD='enter-the-password'
```

```shell script
python manage.py makemigrations
